>to build your own database on your server and config the query connection with your own ip address.

>Also take a note that because of fetching data is a future function, you will see an error screen at first. However,
>just press in 1 in 4 buttons in the bottom bar to change screen and press Home to return to home screen. Now, everything
>will be fine.
